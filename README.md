Notes
You can use Lit to encrypt and store any static content. Examples of static content are files or strings. You need to store the ciphertext and metadata yourself (on IPFS, Arweave, or even a centralized storage solution), and the Lit network will enforce who is allowed to decrypt it.

Steps

1. Encrpt message using Auth keys (managed by Lit)
2. Sign the encrypted message with my private key
